        <h3>Be Thankful for Life</h3>
        <p>When I was younger, around 6 years old, I had an overwhelming fear of death that caused me to not live my life to its fullest capacity. I realized one day that life is really short, and I shouldn't fear that, but 
        instead live in the moment and be thankful for the oppetunity to live.</p>
        <p>It's important to me because I still use this mindset to this day to be a better person, avoid stress, and make better decisions.</p>
        <p>We see this all around us, people taking life for granted and choosing to either waste it or do harm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>We are Responsbile for the Decisisons we Make</h3>
        <p>Around the same time of discovering the concept of death, I realized that we all have free will. Every second of every day we are all making unique decisions which make up our lives, and the choices that we
        make genuinely matter.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about this because I feel that people should be and feel responsible for their actions. I hate seeing people blame external factors or make excuses for making terrible decisions.</p>
        <p>When people don't accept accoutability or responsibility for their actions, it is much easier to make imoral decisions and cause harm because you are able to justify it by saying its not your own fault.</p>
