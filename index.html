            <h3>Be Thankful For Life</h3>
            <p>When I was younger, around 6 years old, I had an overwhelming fear of death that caused me to not live my life to its fullest capacity. I realized one day that life is really short, and I shouldn't fear that, but instead live in the moment and be thankful for the oppetunity to live.</p>
            <p>It's important to me because I still use this mindset to this day to be a better person, avoid stress, and make better decisions.</p>
            <p>We see this all around us, people taking life for granted and choosing to either waste their life away or do harm. We should all strive to make the most of our life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>We Are Responsible For The Decisions We Make</h3>
            <p>Around the same time of discovering the concept of death, I realized that we all have free will. Every second of every day we are all making unique decisions which make up our lives, and the choices that we make genuinely matter.</p>
            <p>I'm very passionate about this because I feel that people should be and feel responsible for their actions. I hate seeing people blame external factors or make excuses for making terrible decisions.</p>
            <p>When people don't accept accountability or responsibility for their actions, it is much easier to make immoral decisions and cause harm because you are able to justify it by saying it's not your own fault.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Make Other Lives Better</h3>
            <p>Senior year of high school I had a series of adversities and I ended up as an independent, homeless, and tore my ACL all within a week. It was because of the kindness of a Christian family that I was able to recover and get myself back on track for college and life.</p>
            <p>I feel this is important because if we all chose to make others' lives better, our society would be in a much better place.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Give People A Break</h3>
            <p>Earlier in my life, I had very little empathy or understanding for others. I was very objective and not forgiving, but as I matured, I learned that it is very important to be understanding. A key point in helping me learn this was 8th grade when we had a classmate arrive upset, and the teacher asked for her homework...</p>

            <h3>All Forms of Conscious Lives Have Some Form Of A Soul And Should Be Treated Accordingly</h3>
            <p>I just truly feel sick to my stomach when I see people mistreating other organisms such as animals just because they are not human. Like I said, it takes conscious effort to do harm...</p>
