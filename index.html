        <h2>Ethics</h2>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Be Thankful For Life</h3>
        <p>When I was younger, around 6 years old, I had an overwhelming fear of death that caused me to not live my life to its fullest capacity. I realized one day that life is really short, and I shouldn't fear that, but 
        instead live in the moment and be thankful for the oppetunity to live.</p>
        <p>It's important to me because I still use this mindset to this day to be a better person, avoid stress, and make better decisions.</p>
        <p>We see this all around us, people taking life for granted and choosing to either waste their life away or do harm. We should all strive to make the most of our life.</p>
    </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>We Are Responsible For The Decisions We Make</h3>
            <p>Around the same time of discovering the concept of death, I realized that we all have free will. Every second of every day we are all making unique decisions which make up our lives, and the choices that we
        make genuinely matter.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about this because I feel that people should be and feel responsible for their actions. I hate seeing people blame external factors or make excuses for making terrible decisions.</p>
        <p>When people don't accept accoutability or responsibility for their actions, it is much easier to make imoral decisions and cause harm because you are able to justify it by saying its not your own fault. 
        For example, soldiers in war are told that their actions are not their fault, that the people they are killing are subhuman, and they are fighting for a cause. These people end up being exploited, and once
        they realize the gravity of the decisions they have made, it is too late and the next class of soliders is already there to replace them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="card">
            <h3>Make Other Lives Better</h3>
             <p>Senior year of high school I had a series of adversities and I ended up as an independent, homeless, and tore my acl all within a week. It was because of the kindess of a Christian family that I was able to 
        recover and get myself back on track for college and life. This not only got me back into religion, but it also showed me just how powerful your decisions can be for others, and how choosing to help someone
        can literally save their life.</p>
        <p>I feel this is important because in we all chose to make other's lives better, our society we be in a much better place. </p>
        <p>When we have people that choose to use their limited time alive to make other lives harder, this brings down the overall state of the world and society itself. Every time someone harms another person,
        that is a conscious decision, if we made people more aware of their actions, and more people chose to do good, the world could change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Give People A Break</h3>
            <p>Earlier in my life I had very little empathy or understnading for others. I was very objective and was not forgiving, but as 
        I matured I learned that it is very important to be understanding. A key point in helping me learn this was 8th grade when we had
        a classmate arrive to class and was visibily upset, the teacher asked for her homework, and she wasn't able to provide it, 
        the teacher called her out in front of the entire class and spent a period of time calling her lazy and how students should
        not miss deadlines. After the teacher got done, the girl was crying and simply said "My dad died and we won't have a home anymore".
        The teacher went dead silent and it really just tought me that you have no clue what someone is going through.</p>
        <p>I take this seriously because I have started to give people a little slack when I find myself in leadership positions and
        this has gone a long way. Showing an understanding and compassion for those around you can mean the world to someone who is
        going through something.</p>
        <p>Being compassionless and demonstrating a lack of empathy only negatively impacts the people that you are directly around or
        in charge of.</p>

            <h3>All Forms of Conscious Lives Have Some Form Of A Soul And Should Be Treated Accordingly</h3>
            <p>I just truly feel sick to my stomach when I see people mistreating other organisms such as animals just because they are not
        human. Like I said, it takes conscious effort to do harm, so choosing to harm other living things for no reason is so worng
        to me. I am by no means vegan, but I feel that the only justification for harming animals should be for sustaining life, 
        or for self preservation.</p>
        <p>We have a society that has a huge unregulated domestication culture. You can legally purchase a domesticated animal with
        extremely little effort. This means that we have many animals that end up in terrible homes, or end up abandoned or killed.
        We also give animals that are used for mass food production terrible lives. Their short time alive is spent in tight cages, or
        in pain.</p>
        <p>I don't really think there's any physical consequences to this besides the emotional and physical harm that is caused
        to these organisms, but I think morally and ethically it is wrong and something that should be handled better.</p>
