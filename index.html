        <h3>Be Thankful For Life</h3>
        <p>When I was younger, around 6 years old, I had an overwhelming fear of death that caused me to not live my life to its fullest capacity. I realized one day that life is really short, and I shouldn't fear that, but 
        instead live in the moment and be thankful for the oppetunity to live.</p>
        <p>It's important to me because I still use this mindset to this day to be a better person, avoid stress, and make better decisions.</p>
        <p>We see this all around us, people taking life for granted and choosing to either waste it or do harm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>We Are Responsbile For The Decisisons We Make</h3>
        <p>Around the same time of discovering the concept of death, I realized that we all have free will. Every second of every day we are all making unique decisions which make up our lives, and the choices that we
        make genuinely matter.</p>
        <p>I'm very passionate about this because I feel that people should be and feel responsible for their actions. I hate seeing people blame external factors or make excuses for making terrible decisions.</p>
        <p>When people don't accept accoutability or responsibility for their actions, it is much easier to make imoral decisions and cause harm because you are able to justify it by saying its not your own fault. 
        For example, soldiers in war are told that their actions are not their fault, that the people they are killing are subhuman, and they are fighting for a cause. These people end up being exploited, and once
        they realize the gravity of the decisions they have made, it is too late and the next class of soliders is already there to replace them.</p>

        <h3>Make Other Lives Better</h3>
        <p>Senior year of high school I had a series of adversities and I ended up as an independent, homeless, and tore my acl all within a week. It was because of the kindess of a Christian family that I was able to 
        recover and get myself back on track for college and life. This not only got me back into religion, but it also showed me just how powerful your decisions can be for others, and how choosing to help someone
        can literally save their life.</p>
        <p>I feel this is important because in we all chose to make other's lives better, our society we be in a much better place. </p>
        <p>When we have people that choose to use their limited time alive to make other lives harder, this brings down the overall state of the world and society itself. Every time someone harms another person,
        that is a conscious decision, if we made people more aware of their actions, and more people chose to do good, the world could change.</p>
